          This report estimates the individual's level on each of the five
          broad personality domains of the Five-Factor Model. The description
          of each one of the five broad domains is followed by a more detailed
          description of personality according to the six subdomains that
          comprise each domain.
        </p>

        <p>
          <I>A note on terminology</i>. Personality traits describe, relative
          to other people, the frequency or intensity of a person's feelings,
          thoughts, or behaviors. Possession of a trait is therefore a matter
          of degree. We might describe two individuals as <I>extraverts</i>,
          but still see one as more extraverted than the other. This report
          uses expressions such as "extravert" or "high in extraversion" to
          describe someone who is likely to be seen by others as relatively
          extraverted. The computer program that generates this report
          classifies you as low, average, or high in a trait according to
          whether your score is approximately in the lowest 30%, middle 40%, or
          highest 30% of scores obtained by people of your sex and roughly your
          age. Your numerical scores are reported and graphed as <I>percentile
            estimates</i>. For example, a score of "60" means that your level
          on that trait is estimated to be higher than 60% of persons of your
          sex and age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please keep in mind that "low," "average," and "high" scores on a
          personality test are neither absolutely good nor bad. A particular
          level on any trait will probably be neutral or irrelevant for a great
          many activities, be helpful for accomplishing some things, and
          detrimental for accomplishing other things. As with any personality
          inventory, scores and descriptions can only approximate an
          individual's actual personality. High and low score descriptions are
          usually accurate, but average scores close to the low or high
          boundaries might misclassify you as only average. On each set of six
          subdomain scales it is somewhat uncommon but certainly possible to
          score high in some of the subdomains and low in the others. In such
          cases more attention should be paid to the subdomain scores than to
          the broad domain score. Questions about the accuracy of your results
          are best resolved by showing your report to people who know you well.

          John A. Johnson wrote descriptions of the five domains and thirty
          subdomains. These descriptions are based on an extensive reading of
          the scientific literature on personality measurement. Although Dr.
          Johnson would like to be acknowledged as the author of these
          materials if they are reproduced, he has placed them in the public
          domain.

        <h2>Extraversion</h2>
        <p>
          Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external
          world. Extraverts enjoy being with people, are full of energy, and
          often experience positive emotions. They tend to be enthusiastic,
          action-oriented, individuals who are likely to say "Yes!" or "Let's
          go!" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk,
          assert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          Introverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of
          extraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and
          disengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement
          should <U>not</u> be interpreted as shyness or depression; the
          introvert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers
          to be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is
          sometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an
          introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not
          seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.

        <H3>Extraversion Facets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <I>Friendliness</i>. Friendly people genuinely like other people
            and openly demonstrate positive feelings toward others. They make
            friends quickly and it is easy for them to form close, intimate
            relationships. Low scorers on Friendliness are not necessarily cold
            and hostile, but they do not reach out to others and are perceived
            as distant and reserved. Your level of friendliness is {{flev[7]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Gregariousness</i>. Gregarious people find the company of
            others pleasantly stimulating and rewarding. They enjoy the
            excitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and
            therefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily
            dislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and
            time to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score
            high on this scale. Your level of gregariousness is {{flev[8]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Assertiveness</i>. High scorers Assertiveness like to speak
            out, take charge, and direct the activities of others. They tend to
            be leaders in groups. Low scorers tend not to talk much and let
            others control the activities of groups. Your level of
            assertiveness is {{flev[9]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Activity Level</i>. Active individuals lead fast-paced, busy
            lives. They move about quickly, energetically, and vigorously, and
            they are involved in many activities. People who score low on this
            scale follow a slower and more leisurely, relaxed pace. Your
            activity level is {{flev[10]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Excitement-Seeking</i>. High scorers on this scale are easily
            bored without high levels of stimulation. They love bright lights
            and hustle and bustle. They are likely to take risks and seek
            thrills. Low scorers are overwhelmed by noise and commotion and are
            averse to thrill-seeking. Your level of excitement-seeking is
            {{flev[11]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Cheerfulness</i>. This scale measures positive mood and
            feelings, not negative emotions (which are a part of the
            Neuroticism domain). Persons who score high on this scale typically
            experience a range of positive feelings, including happiness,
            enthusiasm, optimism, and joy. Low scorers are not as prone to such
            energetic, high spirits. Your level of positive emotions is
            {{flev[12]}}.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Agreeableness</h2>
        <p>
          Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with
          cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting
          along with others. They are therefore considerate, friendly,
          generous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with
          others'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human
          nature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and
          trustworthy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with
          others.  They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and
          therefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.
          Sometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be
          suspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining
          popularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable
          people. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations
          that require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable
          people can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.

        % end

        % if SA > HI:

          cooperative. </p>
        % end

        <h3>Agreeableness Facets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <I>Trust</i>. A person with high trust assumes that most people
            are fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust
            see others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous. Your
            level of trust is {{flev[19]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Morality</i>. High scorers on this scale see no need for
            pretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore
            candid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain
            amount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People
            find it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward
            high-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult
            to relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It
            should be made clear that low scorers are <U>not</u> unprincipled
            or immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly
            reveal the whole truth. Your level of morality is {{flev[20]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Altruism</i>. Altruistic people find helping other people
            genuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to
            assist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing
            things for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than
            self-sacrifice. Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like
            helping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition
            rather than an opportunity for self-fulfillment. Your level of
            altruism is {{flev[21]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Cooperation</i>. Individuals who score high on this scale
            dislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or
            to deny their own needs in order to get along with others. Those
            who score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to
            get their way. Your level of cooperation is {{flev[22]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Modesty</i>. High scorers on this scale do not like to claim
            that they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude
            may derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless,
            some people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly. Those
            who <U>are</u> willing to describe themselves as superior tend to
            be seen as disagreeably arrogant by other people. Your level of
            modesty is {{flev[23]}}.  </li>
          <li> <I>Sympathy</i>. People who score high on this scale are
            tenderhearted and compassionate. They feel the pain of others
            vicariously and are easily moved to pity. Low scorers are not
            affected strongly by human suffering. They pride themselves on
            making objective judgments based on reason. They are more concerned
            with truth and impartial justice than with mercy. Your level of
            tender-mindedness is {{flev[24]}}.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conscientiousness</h2>
        <p>
          Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate,
          and direct our impulses. Impulses are not inherently bad;
          occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on
          our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of
          play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be
          fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,
          fun-to-be-with, and zany.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of
          ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts
          not only harm other members of society, but also can result in
          retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another
          problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate
          rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include
          excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,
          hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important
          relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually
          destroy one's health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes
          a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively
          disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which
          would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also
          sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences
          of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are
          therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings
          from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future
          consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity
          involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning
          routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face
          of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence
          involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an
          alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means
          both wise and cautious. Persons who score high on the
          Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as
          intelligent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious
          individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through
          purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively
          regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative
          side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.
          Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded
          as stuffy and boring. Unconscientious people may be criticized for
          their unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within
          the lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and
          they will never be called stuffy.

          <li> <I>Self-Efficacy</i>. Self-Efficacy describes confidence in one's ability

            (common sense), drive, and self-control necessary for achieving success.
            Low scorers do not feel effective, and may have a sense that they are not
            in control of their lives. Your level of self-efficacy is {{flev[25]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Orderliness</i>. Persons with high scores on orderliness are
            well-organized. They like to live according to routines and schedules. They
            keep lists and make plans. Low scorers tend to be disorganized and
            scattered. Your level of orderliness is {{flev[26]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Dutifulness</i>. This scale reflects the strength of a person's sense
            of duty and obligation. Those who score high on this scale have a strong
            sense of moral obligation. Low scorers find contracts, rules, and
            regulations overly confining. They are likely to be seen as unreliable or
            even irresponsible. Your level of dutifulness is {{flev[27]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Achievement-Striving</i>. Individuals who score high on this
            scale strive hard to achieve excellence. Their drive to be recognized as
            successful keeps them on track toward their lofty goals. They often have
            a strong sense of direction in life, but extremely high scores may
            be too single-minded and obsessed with their work. Low scorers are content
            to get by with a minimal amount of work, and might be seen by others
            as lazy. Your level of achievement striving is {{flev[28]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Self-Discipline</i>. Self-discipline-what many people call
            will-power-refers to the ability to persist at difficult or unpleasant
            tasks until they are completed. People who possess high self-discipline
            are able to overcome reluctance to begin tasks and stay on track despite
            distractions. Those with low self-discipline procrastinate and show poor
            follow-through, often failing to complete tasks-even tasks they want very
            much to complete. Your level of self-discipline is {{flev[29]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Cautiousness</i>. Cautiousness describes the disposition to
            think through possibilities before acting. High scorers on the Cautiousness
            scale take their time when making decisions. Low scorers often say or do
            first thing that comes to mind without deliberating alternatives and the
            probable consequences of those alternatives. Your level
            of cautiousness is {{flev[30]}}.

        <h2>Neuroticism</h2>
        <p>
          Freud originally used the term <I>neurosis</I> to describe a
          condition marked by mental distress, emotional suffering, and an
          inability to cope effectively with the normal demands of life. He
          suggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we
          differ in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of
          distress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience
          negative feelings. Those who score high on Neuroticism may
          experience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety,
          anger, or depression, but are likely to experience several of these
          emotions. People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They
          respond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and
          their reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more
          likely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor
          frustrations as hopelessly difficult. Their negative emotional
          reactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which
          means they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional
          regulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make
          decisions, and cope effectively with stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the other end of the scale, individuals who score low in
          neuroticism are less easily upset and are less emotionally reactive.
          They tend to be calm, emotionally stable, and free from persistent
          negative feelings. Freedom from negative feelings does not mean that
          low scorers experience a lot of positive feelings; frequency of
          positive emotions is a component of the Extraversion domain.

        <h3>Neuroticism Facets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <I>Anxiety</i>. The "fight-or-flight" system of the brain of anxious
            individuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who
            are high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen.
            They may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful.
            They feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally
            calm and fearless. Your level of anxiety is {{flev[1]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Anger</i>. Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when
            things do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly
            and feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated.
            This scale measures the tendency to <I>feel</I> angry; whether or not the
            person <I>expresses</I> annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's
            level on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.
            Your level of anger is {{flev[2]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Depression</i>. This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected,
            and discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficult initiating
            activities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.
            Your level of depression is {{flev[3]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Self-Consciousness</i>. Self-conscious individuals are sensitive
            about what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and
            ridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable around others. They
            are easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others
            will criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but
            their awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling
            prophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken
            impression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel
            nervous in social situations. Your level of self-consciousness is
            {{flev[4]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Immoderation</i>. Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and
            urges that they have have difficulty resisting. They tend to be
            oriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long-
            term consequences. Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible
            cravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge.
            Your level of immoderation is {{flev[5]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Vulnerability</i>. High scorers on Vulnerability experience
            panic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress.
            Low scorers feel more poised, confident, and clear-thinking when
            stressed.  Your level of vulnerability is {{flev[6]}}.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Openness to Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that
          distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth,
          conventional people. Open people are intellectually curious,
          appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be,
          compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to
          think and act in individualistic and nonconforming
          ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience;
          consequently, this factor has also been called <I>Culture</I> or
          <I>Intellect</I>. Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness
          to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly
          related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking
          in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on
          the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may
          take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and
          metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the
          many visual or performing arts.
          People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common
          interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the
          complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with
          suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use.
          Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and
          resistant to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who
          are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of
          thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the
          open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed
          thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and
          a number of service occupations.

        <h3>Openness Facets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> <I>Imagination</i>. To imaginative individuals, the real world is
            often too plain and ordinary. High scorers on this scale use fantasy as a
            way of creating a richer, more interesting world. Low scorers are on this
            scale are more oriented to facts than fantasy. Your level of imagination
            is {{flev[13]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Artistic Interests</i>. High scorers on this scale love beauty, both in
            art and in nature. They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic
            and natural events. They are not necessarily artistically trained nor
            talented, although many will be. The defining features of this scale are
            <I>interest in</I>, and <I>appreciation of</I> natural and
            artificial beauty. Low scorers lack aesthetic sensitivity and interest in
            the arts. Your level of artistic interests is {{flev[14]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Emotionality</i>. Persons high on Emotionality have good access
            to and awareness of their own feelings. Low scorers are less aware of
            their feelings and tend not to express their emotions openly. Your
            level of emotionality is {{flev[15]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Adventurousness</i>. High scorers on adventurousness are eager to
            try new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different
            things. They find familiarity and routine boring, and will take a new
            route home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel
            uncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines. Your level of
            adventurousness is {{flev[16]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Intellect</i>. Intellect and artistic interests are the two most
            important, central aspects of openness to experience. High scorers on
            Intellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual
            ideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles,
            and brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either
            people or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a
            waste of time. Intellect should <U>not</u> be equated with intelligence.
            Intellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although
            high scorers on Intellect score <U>slightly</u> higher than low-Intellect
            individuals on standardized intelligence tests. Your level of intellect
            is {{flev[17]}}.
          </li>
          <li> <I>Liberalism</i>. Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to
            challenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most
            extreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright
            hostility toward rules, sympathy for law-breakers, and love of ambiguity,
            chaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and
            stability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism
            and conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly
            incline individuals toward certain political parties. Your level of
            liberalism is {{flev[18]}}.
