          Warning about this 120-Item Version of the IPIP-NEO
        </h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Thus far, no program failures for the 120-item version of the
            IPIP-NEO have been reported for persons who have answered all of
            the items. However, recently a number of individuals have reported
            that the program tells them they have not checked the two
            acknowledgement boxes on this page, even when they have. For some
            reason, this may occur with older Web browsers, so if this happens
            to you, you might consider trying again with a more recent version
            of your Web browser or with a different Web browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            To access the test, you <u>must</u> indicate that you understand
            that taking the test does not guarantee receiving results.
          </li>
          <li>

                  Yes, I understand that responding to all items on this
                  inventory is time consuming and that technical difficulties
                  may prevent the results from being displayed. I am responding
                  to this inventory with the full knowledge of the risk that I
                  might not receive results. I accept full responsibility and
                  risk for the time I invest in responding to this
                  inventory.

            If the Program Does Crash...
          </h2>
          ..and you are using an older Web browser, first try using a newer
          browser. A number of people have recently reported overcoming
          problems simply by using a newer browser. Whatever your problem, I
          want to know about it. If you experience any technical difficulties
          (items fail to appear on the screen, test does not advance to next
          page, Web browser freezes, no narrative report is displayed, etc.) I
          encourage you to send an email describing
          the problem to me at <b><a href="mailto:j5j@psu.edu">j5j@psu.edu</a>.
          </b> Other persons who may have referred you to this site would
          prefer that you report technical difficulties to me rather than to
          them.

            Purpose of this On-Line Inventory
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The primary purpose of this on line inventory is to educate the public
              about the <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~sanjay/bigfive.html">five factor model
                of personality</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              More specifically, the report explains the likely consequences of
              one's standing on five broad personality domains.
            </li>
            <li>
              These broad domains cover normal differences in personality that
              should be obvious to people who know you well.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secondarily, this inventory estimates your standing on the 5
              broad domains and 30 subdomains of personality.
            </li>
            <li>
              The inventory does not reveal hidden, secret information about
              you nor does it assess serious psychological disorders.
            </li>
            <li>
              The report is designed to be objective, not pleasing or
              flattering.
            </li>
            <li>
              Measurement error, misunderstandings, carelessness, and
              mischievous responding can invalidate the report.
            </li>
            <li>
              If knowledgeable acquaintances disagree with the test results,
              then the results are wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Acknowledgment that You Understand the Limitations of the Test
            Results

                  Yes, I understand that the primary purpose of this site is to
                  educate the public about the five factor model of
                  personality, and only secondarily, to estimate the
                  respondent's standing within the five factor model. I
                  understand that the program that generates the report is
                  designed to produce estimates that are as accurate as
                  possible, but that measurement error or improper responding
                  can produce inaccurate results. If I think I have answered
                  the items honestly and carefully but my results are
                  inaccurate or not as pleasing as I would like them to be, I
                  will have knowledgeable acquaintances evaluate the validity
                  of the report before contacting Dr. Johnson. If I choose to
                  critique the test or narrative report after receiving
                  feedback from knowledgeable acquaintances, I will do so in a
                  courteous and civil manner.

              The IPIP-NEO is <b><u>not</u></b> equivalent to the commercial

              Paul T. Costa, Jr. and Robert R. McCrae. The genuine NEO
              PI-R&trade; (240 items) is considered by many psychologists to be
              the best inventory for measuring traits within the Five Factor
              Model (FFM) of personality. The NEO PI-R&trade; is copyrighted by
